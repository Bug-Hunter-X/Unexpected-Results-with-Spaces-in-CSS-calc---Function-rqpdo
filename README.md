This repository demonstrates an uncommon bug in CSS related to the use of spaces within the `calc()` function. The bug.css file contains the erroneous code, and the bugSolution.css file provides the corrected version. The issue arises from spaces being present around the operators within the `calc()` function, which can lead to unexpected layout or rendering behavior.  The solution involves removing these unnecessary spaces to ensure correct calculation and rendering.
